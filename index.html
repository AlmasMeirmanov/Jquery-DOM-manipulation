          This is lesson two. I hope the monkey dance was everything you hoped
          it would be. today we will learn the intriguing dance of the hippo.
          This dance starts from the hips and wiggles down to your knees. if you
          don't know how that works then go back to the basics which is the
          monkey dance.

          animal dancer and you have learned the ways of the wild. happy people!
